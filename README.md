OpenAI fork, with pinned dependencies and made to work with Python 3. Highly experimental.

```

or

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/KarimJedda/swarm.git

## Usage

```python
from swarm import Swarm, Agent

client = Swarm()

def transfer_to_agent_b():
    return agent_b


agent_a = Agent(
    name="Agent A",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    functions=[transfer_to_agent_b],
)

agent_b = Agent(
    name="Agent B",
    instructions="Only speak in Haikus.",
)

response = client.run(
    agent=agent_a,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "I want to talk to agent B."}],
)

print(response.messages[-1]["content"])

```
Hope glimmers brightly,
New paths converge gracefully,
What can I assist?
